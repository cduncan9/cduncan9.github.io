## Light Box

This light box device was built as a project for Medical Device Design I at Duke University. It is meant to demonstrate the technical skills that I have learned over the course of the semester. This project involved the use of Onshape for the CAD work and EAGLE for the design of the circuit and PCB. Click [here](lightbox.md) for more on the specifications of the light box and for details on the tests performed on the final product.
