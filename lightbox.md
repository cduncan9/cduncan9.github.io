# Light Box
## User Needs
This project was meant to serve as a final skills assessment for BME 473. All of the skills learned throughout the class would be used to contruct a final design that met many user design needs. These needs were kept in mind throughout the enire design process and final product assembly. The user needs as specified in the rubric for this project are listed below:

* Switch to turn device on/off
* Rotary knob to linearly modulate the brightness of the light
* Switch to toggle from a continuous to a 2 Hz blinking mode (50% duty cycle)
* Use a 9V battery
* Battery must be easily replaceable
* Battery life of at least 4 hours
* Single-sided printed circuit board
* Weigh less than half a pound
* All dimensions must be less than 3 inches
* Enclosure must be sealed
* It must cost less than $20 to replicate the unit
* It must be able to survive a 3 ft drop test

## Design Process

The enclosing of the light box was designed in Onshape. Throughout the entire design process, specific decisions were made to successfully meet all of the user needs. The light box enclosing was designed in three parts consisting of a top piece, bottom piece, and battery cover. This three piece design was meant to improve the ease of access to the internal components of the lightbox for quick battery replacement and electrical troubleshooting. 

The top piece of this box was designed to have openings for the light and the switch hardware to protrude from. On the top face of the box there are three holes that are 0.3 inches in diameter. These holes enable the user to see the light from the LED and to control the sttings of the light through the switch and potentiometer knob. 

The top piece also has 4 holes at the corners where SCREW SIZE screws are inserted to screw together the top and bottom pieces.

On the bottom of the top piece there is a 0.1 inch inner ridge where extrusions of the bottom piece will fit to help align the pieces.

The mechanical drawing for the top piece can be found [here](https://github.com/cduncan9/cduncan9.github.io/blob/main/Top%20Piece%20Drawing%20(1).pdf).

The bottom piece of the light box is where most of the features for the user needs are kept. The bottom piece has features for the storage of the battery, mounting of the PCB, and connecting the bottom and top pieces together.

Around the rim of the lightbox are four 0.1 inch tall protrusions. These protrusions couple with the inside of the rim of the top piece to guide the pieces together during assembly. 



The mechanical drawing for the bottom piece can be found [here](https://github.com/cduncan9/cduncan9.github.io/blob/main/Bottom%20Piece%20Drawing%20(2).pdf).

The mechanical drawing for the battery cover can be found [here](https://github.com/cduncan9/cduncan9.github.io/blob/main/Battery%20Cover%20Drawing%20(2).pdf).

The overall assembly for the light box was designed to be sturdy and ergonomic. A 0.3 inch fillet was applied to all edges of the lightbox to reduce the stress on the edges during the drop test. The lightbox also has a uniform wall thickness of 0.2 inches to frotect its internals during a fall.
