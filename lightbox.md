# Light Box
## User Needs
This project was meant to serve as a final skills assessment for BME 473. All of the skills learned throughout the class would be used to contruct a final design that met many user design needs. These needs were kept in mind throughout the enire design process and final product assembly. The user needs as specified in the rubric for this project are listed below:

* Switch to turn device on/off
* Rotary knob to linearly modulate the brightness of the light
* Switch to toggle from a continuous to a 2 Hz blinking mode (50% duty cycle)
* Use a 9V battery
* Battery must be easily replaceable
* Battery life of at least 4 hours
* Single-sided printed circuit board
* Weigh less than half a pound
* All dimensions must be less than 3 inches
* Enclosure must be sealed
* It must cost less than $20 to replicate the unit
* It must be able to survive a 3 ft drop test

## Design Process

The enclosing of the light box was designed in Onshape. Throughout the entire design process, specific decisions were made to successfully meet all of the user needs. The light box enclosing was designed in three parts consisting of a top piece, bottom piece, and battery cover. This three piece design was meant to improve the ease of access to the internal components of the lightbox for quick battery replacement and electrical troubleshooting. 

The mechanical drawing for the top piece can be found [here](https://github.com/cduncan9/cduncan9.github.io/blob/main/Top%20Piece%20Drawing%20(1).pdf).

The mechanical drawing for the bottom piece can be found [here](https://github.com/cduncan9/cduncan9.github.io/blob/main/Bottom%20Piece%20Drawing%20(2).pdf).

The mechanical drawing for the battery cover can be found [here](https://github.com/cduncan9/cduncan9.github.io/blob/main/Battery%20Cover%20Drawing%20(2).pdf).
